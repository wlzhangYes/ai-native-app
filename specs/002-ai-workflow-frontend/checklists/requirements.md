**Failed**: 0

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review

1. **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS
   - The spec avoids mentioning specific React components, Jotai atoms, or Axios configurations
   - Technical constraints are appropriately documented in a separate section labeled "Technical Constraints (optional)"
   - User stories and requirements focus on user interactions and system behavior, not implementation

2. **Focused on user value**: ✅ PASS
   - Each user story clearly explains the value to users (see "Why this priority" sections)
   - Requirements describe what users can do and what outcomes they achieve
   - Success criteria measure user experience and business value (e.g., SC-015: User satisfaction score 4.0+)

3. **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✅ PASS
   - Language is accessible and avoids technical jargon in user stories
   - Functional requirements use "System MUST" format that is clear to business stakeholders
   - Edge cases are written as plain language questions

4. **All mandatory sections completed**: ✅ PASS
   - User Scenarios & Testing: ✅ (9 user stories with priorities)
   - Requirements: ✅ (104 functional requirements)
   - Key Entities: ✅ (9 entities defined)
   - Success Criteria: ✅ (15 measurable outcomes)

### Requirement Completeness Review

5. **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ PASS
   - Searched entire spec.md: 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found
   - All requirements are fully specified with concrete details

6. **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: ✅ PASS
   - Each FR has a clear "System MUST" statement
   - Examples:
     - FR-001: "System MUST display a three-column layout with a ratio of 3:2:5" (specific ratio provided)
     - FR-080: "System MUST check project name uniqueness during creation; if a duplicate name exists, prompt the user to choose a different name" (clear condition and action)
     - FR-081: "System MUST limit project names to 255 characters maximum" (specific limit)

7. **Success criteria are measurable**: ✅ PASS
   - All 15 success criteria include quantitative metrics
   - Examples:
     - SC-001: "under 2 seconds" (time)
     - SC-003: "90% of users" (percentage)
     - SC-006: "100 concurrent users" (volume)
     - SC-015: "4.0 or higher out of 5.0" (rating scale)

8. **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ PASS
   - No mention of React, TypeScript, Jotai, or other technologies in success criteria
   - All criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (load time, completion time, user satisfaction)
   - Example: SC-004 says "AI responses stream to the dialog panel with latency under 500ms" (user experience) instead of "SSE response time under 500ms" (technical detail)

9. **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: ✅ PASS
   - Each user story includes multiple Given-When-Then scenarios
   - User Story 1: 3 scenarios
   - User Story 2: 4 scenarios
   - User Story 3: 3 scenarios
   - User Story 4: 3 scenarios
   - User Story 5: 4 scenarios
   - User Story 6: 3 scenarios
   - User Story 7: 4 scenarios
   - User Story 8: 3 scenarios
   - User Story 9: 3 scenarios
   - Total: 30 acceptance scenarios

10. **Edge cases are identified**: ✅ PASS
    - 8 edge cases documented with clear questions and handling strategies
    - Examples:
      - IAM session expiration during workflow
      - Extremely long AI responses (>10,000 words)
      - Rapid stage switching
      - Multiple simultaneous editors
      - AMDP service unavailability
      - Invalid Trickle links
      - Network disconnection during SSE
      - Unauthorized project access

11. **Scope is clearly bounded**: ✅ PASS
    - "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 11 features deferred to future versions
    - Examples: mobile support, multi-language, collaborative editing, version rollback UI, custom workflows, code package upload
    - MVP范围 clearly defined in user input

12. **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✅ PASS
    - Assumptions section: 9 assumptions documented
    - Dependencies section: 7 dependencies documented (IAM, AMDP, Feishu, Backend AI, SSE, Speech-to-Text, Trickle)

### Feature Readiness Review

13. **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
    - While acceptance criteria are in user stories (not directly linked to each FR), all FRs can be traced to acceptance scenarios
    - Example: FR-001 (three-column layout) → User Story 1, Scenario 1
    - Example: FR-050 (pause task) → User Story 6, Scenario 3

14. **User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
    - Priority P1 stories (US1, US2) cover foundational interface and dialog interaction
    - Priority P2 stories (US3, US4) cover workflow visualization and document generation
    - Priority P3 stories (US5, US6) cover editing and session persistence
    - Priority P4 stories (US7, US8) cover project management and notifications
    - Priority P5 story (US9) covers external integration and export
    - All 5 workflow stages (0-4) are covered in requirements FR-038 through FR-042

15. **Feature meets measurable outcomes in Success Criteria**: ✅ PASS
    - User stories align with success criteria:
      - US1 (three-column interface) → SC-001 (load time <2s), SC-003 (90% understand layout)
      - US2 (dialog interaction) → SC-004 (stream latency <500ms)
      - US4 (document generation) → SC-005 (generation <30s)
      - US6 (session persistence) → SC-007 (persist 99% of time), SC-014 (95% tasks continue in background)
      - US7 (project management) → SC-010 (search <3s), SC-011 (permission changes <5s)
      - US9 (export) → SC-012 (export <10s)

16. **No implementation details leak into specification**: ✅ PASS
    - Implementation details are confined to "Technical Constraints" section
    - User stories and requirements do not mention React components, Jotai stores, or specific code structures
    - Exception: Some FRs mention SSE (FR-010) but this is acceptable as SSE is a user-facing behavior (streaming) rather than an implementation detail

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to the `/speckit.plan` phase. All 16 checklist items have passed validation.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage with 9 prioritized user stories and 104 functional requirements
- Clear separation of concerns with distinct user stories for each major feature area
- Excellent edge case analysis (8 edge cases documented)
- Strong measurable outcomes (15 success criteria with specific metrics)
- Well-defined scope with clear "Out of Scope" section

**No critical issues found**.

Optional enhancements for future iterations:
- Consider adding more detail on error messages and user feedback in later refinement
- May want to add wireframes or mockups when available to supplement user stories
